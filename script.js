// 1.[]: This represents an empty array. It's the starting point for the concatenation operation.

// 2.concat(): This is a method available for arrays in JavaScript that is used to concatenate (combine) arrays together. It takes one or more arrays as arguments and returns a new array containing the elements of all the arrays.

// 3. ["John", "Jack"], ["Mary", "Robert"], ["Prince"]: These are three separate arrays, each containing a list of strings. In the context of your example, they are the arrays that you want to concatenate together.
